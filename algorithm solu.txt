Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers
Write an algorithm that calculates the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to a given number n.

Start
insert the number a
set a variable sum to 0
create a loop
	-start a loop from i=1 to i=0
	-add current value of i to sum
end loop when i>n
return the value of sum
End

Find the Maximum of Three Numbers
Write an algorithm that takes three numbers as input and finds the largest of them.

Start
input three numbers a,b,c.
take a variable max and set the value of a to max
compare the numbers using condition statements
	if b>max then set max=b
	if c>max then set max=c
return the value of max
End

Factorial Calculation
Write an algorithm that calculates the factorial of a number n.

Start
insert a variable n
initialize a variable fact to 1
create a FOR loop with specific condition
	-set i from 1 to n
	-multiply fact by i and store the result in fact
end the loop after the condition gets wrong
return the value of fact
End


Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is even or odd.

Start
insert the number n
check the number using condition statements
	-if n%2=0,the number is even
	-else the number is odd
return the result(even or odd)
End
