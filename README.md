#  Algorithm exercises

**Problem 1: Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers**

Write an algorithm that calculates the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to a given number n.

```
The user should input a value for n.
The algorithm should compute the sum using a loop and display the result.
```

**Problem 2: Check for Prime Number**

Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is a prime number or not.
```
The user should input a value for n.
The algorithm should check whether the number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
```

**Problem 3: Find the Maximum of Three Numbers**

Write an algorithm that takes three numbers as input and finds the largest of them.
```
The user should input three values: a, b, and c.
The algorithm should compare the numbers and print the maximum value.
```

**Problem 4: Factorial Calculation**

Write an algorithm that calculates the factorial of a number n.
```
The user should input a number n.
The algorithm should compute the factorial by multiplying all the integers from 1 to n.
```

**Problem 5: Check if a Number is Even or Odd**

Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is even or odd.
```
The user should input a value for n.
